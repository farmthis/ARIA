First, you're going to need a Raspberry Pi, version 4, 4GB+. You should make sure it comes with a power cord and heat sinks.

Next, you'll need a few male/female jumpers for the GPIO pins, like so: https://www.adafruit.com/product/826 (you should get semi-long ones so that they can reach the power relays)

For EACH device you plan to give ARIA independant control of, you'll need a "Controllable Four Outlet Power Relay Module version 2" https://www.adafruit.com/product/2935
