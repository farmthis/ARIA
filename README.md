# ARIA

Heya, this is the WIP, ARIA. The end goal of this project is to create a controler for a variety of devices and toys that has a layer of personality, reacts to user preferences, and makes performance demands. Depending on tools the user gives her control of, ARIA will be able to dole out gratification, punishment, and more. 


The first thing you'll need is the scratch3 offline editor to run or modify this.

It is being designed to run natively on a Raspberry Pi 4, and control a 110V power strip, on/off, via the GPIO pins. 

I'm investigating PWM motor speed control, but it's a longer-term goal.
